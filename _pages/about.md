Hi! I am a computational sociologist who focuses on the interplay between political polarization, public opinion, and online discourse. My research focuses on why people often retreat into silence, avoiding discussions surrounding contentious issues, and how digital platforms can either bridge or deepen these political divides.

My overarching goal is to better understand the dynamics of self-censorship and the expression of unspoken beliefs, particularly when interacting with extreme co- and cross-partisans. Using a combination of surveys, experiments, and simulated social media platforms populated with LLM-based bots, I explore under what conditions people are more or less likely to disclose their "true" opinions.

Interests:
- Quantitative methods
- Causal inference
- Social psychology
- Communication
- Spiral of silence
- Public opinion
- Political polarization
- Social network analysis
