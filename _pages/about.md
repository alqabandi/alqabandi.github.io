Hi! I am a computational sociologist who focuses on the interplay between political polarization, public opinion, and online discourse. I explore why people often retreat into silence, avoiding the discussion surrounding contentious issues, and the role of digital platforms in either bridging or deepening political divides. My overarching goal is to better understand the dynamics of self-censorship and the expression of unspoken beliefs, particularly when interacting with extreme co- and cross-partisans. I use a combination of surveys, experiments, and simulated social media platforms populated with LLM-based bots, to explore under what conditions people are more or less likely to disclose their "true" opinions. 

Interests:
- Quantitative methods
- Causal inference
- Social psychology
- Communication
- Spiral of silence
- Public opinion
- Political polarization
- Social network analysis
