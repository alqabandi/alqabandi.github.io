Hi! I am a computational sociologist who focuses on the interplay between political polarization, public opinion, and online discourse. My work explores the the role of digital platforms in either bridging or deepening political divides. My specific interests lie in the dynamics that drive self-censorship and the expression of unspoken beliefs, [particularly when interacting with extreme co- and cross-partisans](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qpmce). Using a combination of surveys, experiments, and [simulated social media platforms populated with LLM-based bots](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ucfbk), I explore under what conditions people are more or less likely to disclose their "true" opinions. 

For example, my latest (ongoing) project involves a custom-designed social media platform that simulates real social media dynamics. This study aims to explore how exposure to accurate versus exaggerated views of political group attitudes impacts users' willingness to express their genuine opinions, mitigate affective polarization, and engage across party lines.

Another facet of my research examines how online user experiences shape perceptions of political content. A project I recently completed looks at [how offering social media users more control over the content they consume shapes their attitudes about the content as well as the platforms themselves](https://osf.io/ubyac). 

Outside of academia, I enjoy lifting weights, eating Szechuan food, and traveling. I've also just started dabbling in rowing.
