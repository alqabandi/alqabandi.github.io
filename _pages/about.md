Hi! I am a computational sociologist who focuses on the interplay between political polarization, public opinion, and online discourse. I explore why people often retreat into silence or avoid having tough conversations and the role of digital platforms in either bridging or deepening political divides. My overarching goal is to better understand the dynamics of self-censorship and the expression of unspoken beliefs. To get at some of these questions, I use a combination of surveys, experiments, and simulated social media platforms populated with LLM-based bots, to explore under what conditions people are more or less likely to disclose their opinions.
